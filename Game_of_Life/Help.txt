Within the Main Menu, there are three sub-menus.
Below,these menus and their command options are explained in more detail.

[n]ext:
	[n]ext generation:
	    Moves forward one generation. This can also be done by hitting [Enter] from either menu.
	[m]ultiple generations:
	    Displays x number of generations (x = number input by user).
	[s]kip:
	    Skips forward x number of generations and displays final generation created (x = number input by user).
[p]revious:
	[p]revious generation:
	    Moves backwards one generation.
	[b]ack x generations:
	    Like [m]ultiple generations under [n]ext, except goes back x generations instead of forwards.
	[s]kip back x generations:
	    Like [s]kip under [n]ext, except skips backwards x generations instead of forwards.
[e]dit world:
	Change [w]orld size:
	    Allows the user to enter the number of rows and columns.
	    Larger worlds will take longer to be created.
	Change [p]opulation rate:
	    Allows the user to change the initial percent of living cells in the world.
	    This will start over the world’s generation count, as it creates an entirely new world of cells with the same
	    dimentions.
	Change simulation [s]peed:
	    Allows the user to change the speed of displaying generations.
	    The speed of generations being made (specifically in [m]ultiple generations and [b]ack x generations)
	    will either be faster or slower depending on the number the user inputs.
	    The lower the number, the faster the simulation. It’s recommended you use a decimal such as ’0.5’ or ’0.3’.



There are other commands in the Main Menu along these three sub-menus: [o]pen, [s]ave, and [q]uit.

[o]pen world:
   Opens a saved world so the user can see different patterns aside from randomly generated ones.
   A list of saved files will be displayed to select from.
[s]ave world:
    Saves the current world in an editable file. All world files will end file name with ‘.life’.
[q]uit:
    Ends the program. To start the program up again, hit the play button in the top left corner.



Other information:
    A majority of the time it will ask you to enter an integer or number multiple times.
    There is no known cause for this. Sorry if this is an inconvenience to you.
    To continue, simply enter the number a second time and it should work. You do not need to enter another [Enter]
    before you input the value.
